# PowerBi_Amazon_Warehouse_Sales-Dashboard - 15-days-Sales-Forecasting

I have recently completed a PowerBi project aimed at contributing to business success through data analysis techniques, with a major focus on time series analysis for accurate sales forecasting. The project involved several key steps:

1. 𝐃𝐚𝐬𝐡𝐛𝐨𝐚𝐫𝐝 𝐂𝐫𝐞𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧: I started by identifying 𝐤𝐞𝐲 𝐩𝐞𝐫𝐟𝐨𝐫𝐦𝐚𝐧𝐜𝐞 𝐢𝐧𝐝𝐢𝐜𝐚𝐭𝐨𝐫𝐬 (𝐊𝐏𝐈𝐬) and designing an intuitive, visually appealing dashboard. This included adding interactive visualizations and filtering capabilities to allow users to explore data at various levels of granularity.

2. 𝐃𝐚𝐭𝐚 𝐀𝐧𝐚𝐥𝐲𝐬𝐢𝐬: Using PowerBi, I provided valuable insights to business entities regarding the effectiveness of their sales strategies. This was achieved through the creation of visualizations and charts that highlighted important trends and patterns in the data.

3. 𝐒𝐚𝐥𝐞𝐬 𝐅𝐨𝐫𝐞𝐜𝐚𝐬𝐭𝐢𝐧𝐠: Leveraging historic data, I applied time series analysis techniques to generate sales forecasts for the next 15 days. This helped businesses plan their operations and resources more effectively.

The skills and tools used in this project include 𝐃𝐀𝐗 𝐪𝐮𝐞𝐫𝐢𝐞𝐬, 𝐯𝐢𝐬𝐮𝐚𝐥𝐢𝐳𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 𝐜𝐡𝐚𝐫𝐭𝐬, 𝐦𝐚𝐩𝐬, 𝐊𝐏𝐈 𝐜𝐚𝐥𝐜𝐮𝐥𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧, 𝐬𝐥𝐢𝐜𝐞𝐫𝐬, 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐟𝐨𝐫𝐞𝐜𝐚𝐬𝐭𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐭𝐞𝐜𝐡𝐧𝐢𝐪𝐮𝐞𝐬. The end goal of this project was to share valuable insights and actionable information that could drive strategic decision-making and support the store's goals for growth, efficiency, and customer satisfaction.

One of the key learnings from this project was the importance of incorporating data analysis techniques, especially time series analysis, to deliver valuable insights, accurate sales forecasting, and create interactive dashboards that are both informative and easy to understand for all stakeholders.
